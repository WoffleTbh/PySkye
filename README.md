# PySkye
Python wrapper for [SkyeEngine](https://github.com/zTags/SkyeEngine)  
## Setting up
Simply run `python3 build_skye.py` to build the Skye Engine into a single shared library
## Using
`import pyskye as skye` - Pretty obvious  
PySkye supports the entirety of Skye, and it follows the exact same structure. Why? Because then I don't have to write docs
